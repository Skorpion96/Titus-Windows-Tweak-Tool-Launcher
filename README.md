# Titus-Windows-Tweak-Tool-Launcher

Just a launcher for Titus Windows Tweak Tool:https://christitus.com/windows-tool/

I made it because I don't want to remember or check the command everytime

Note that the antivirus can flag the exe as a virus, it is a false positive, just add an exception for it

Before running the file in powers he'll (the first time) paste:

Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned

Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted

Exe generated with https://github.com/MScholtes/PS2EXE
